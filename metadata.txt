Bodyguards & protection agents are the individuals on the front lines for the rich, famous, and powerful. These individuals deal with violence, stalkers, isolation, and potential loss of life every single day.

Bodyguards: Secret Lives from the Watchtower explores the lives of bodyguards; a world most people know very little about. Narrated by Kim Coates (Battlefield Earth, Goon), the film features Justin Bieber and his director of security, Whitey Bulger's protector, 50 Cent, Lil Wayne and Alicia Keys' bodyguard and many more as they protect the famous and the wealthy from any number of external threats.

Diana: The Night She Died (Conspiracy Documentary)

After the death of Diana Princess of Wales, conspiracy theories filled the headlines. As so many of the conspiracy theories are absurd, many simple questions about the fatal night of August 31st have never been asked. By the end not only Princess Diana but also Dodi Al Fayed and the driver Henri Paul were dead.
First, police blamed the paparazzi for causing the accident. They had been "buzzing round the car like flies." Then 48 hours later they blamed the driver of the Mercedes, Henri Paul. He was said to be three times over the drink limit. This compelling program seeks to answer the many questions overlooked by the enquiry and to uncover what really happened the night Diana died.

Awful Interviews That Destroyed Celebs' Careers
Nicki Swift
When you’re a celebrity doing interview-after-interview, it can be exhausting, especially if everyone is asking you the same questions over and over. It’s understandable if even the most beloved of celebrities comes off as just a bit tired or unenthusiastic in some interviews, because everyone has off days.

These celebrity interviews were absolute nightmares, and the very disturbing things that were said in them had extremely negative effects on the stars’ careers. Some tried to take back their words, but the damage had already been done. Let’s take a closer look at celebs who destroyed their careers with one bad interview.

Subscribe to our channel: https://goo.gl/hHvOf8 

In this video, we explore what the fame trap really is, everything from how paparazzi stalk the stars, to the crazy stories they spend to make a buck. We will see which stars, like Justin Bieber and Kanye West, may not be as bad as the press makes them out to be. We will also see how stars like Selena Gomez react to their own fame, and how it has taken over their lives. Plus, we’ll get into the history of the paparazzi and how sometimes staged photos with celebrities make more money. We’ll also show the fun side of paparazzo/celebrity run-ins with some silly photo ops. Then, we will share the lighter side of fame, and which celebs, like Will Smith, are making the most out of it.

“You Asked To See The Monster…so here is the monster you made me” Gary Green wrote, a year after his wife filed for divorce. “There will be five lives taken today – me being the 5th”. Green intended to kill his wife and her three children, shortly after she had requested a divorce. 

Green’s haunting letter stated “I pray the lord allows my soul to enter Heaven. If not I will burn in Hell forever.” He currently resides on death row, after stabbing her more than 20 times and drowning her 6 year old daughter. 

However after pleading for their lives, the two sons managed to escape from their stepfather. Now aged 18 and 21, this is their traumatic and emotional story, told for the first time.

Elizabeth Holmes promised the world a medical revolution. At 19, she claimed to have invented a miniaturised machine that with a single drop of blood could map a person’s health quickly, reliably and cheaply. She boasted that her technology meant serious diseases like cancer would be prevented before they happened. And it was not only a “wow” moment for patients. High-profile investors rushed to pour a fortune into Holmes’ company, Theranos, and she became Silicon Valley’s first self-made female billionaire. But as Tara Brown reports, her invention was an invention – it simply didn’t work. Elizabeth Holmes is no visionary. She’s a cruel fraudster who has put people’s lives at risk, and because of that, now faces 20 years in jail.

He faces court next month accused of concealing child sexual abuse, a charge he denies.

But what makes these attacks even more disturbing is the megachurch's response -- an indifference to their suffering so heartless it would surely make Jesus weep.

SUBSCRIBE TO JOIN THE U UNIVERSE

Celebrity Worship Syndrome occurs when someone displays a hyper fixation on a star that goes far beyond normal social engagement. It can be seen through, although not limited to, those who imitate celebrities as well as stalk their every move. The term was first coined in 2002 by Lynn McCutcheon and has since developed as a real and tangible study in the world of the pop culture obsessed today.

The Killer Caretaker (True Crime Documentary) | Real Stories

From the acclaimed producers of the definitive documentary on Josef Fritzl comes this brand new film investigating the chilling Soham murders and commemorating their tenth anniversary.

On 4th August 2002, school caretaker Ian Huntley murdered 10-year-old friends Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in a quiet village in Cambridgeshire, UK. This was a crime of senseless savagery that shook the international community and brought irreversible fear to the hearts of parents worldwide.

The Soham Murders: Ten Years On tells the true story of the devastating crime in gripping and unflinching detail, painting the picture of a highly manipulative sexual deviant who slipped under the police radar and gained employment at a school.

Through a range of in-depth interviews, the documentary secures exclusive access to individuals who knew Huntley and his girlfriend – some of whom have never spoken before – as well as the key detective, pathologist, criminologist and prosecutor players in the police investigation and trial.

Nicki Swift
Celebrity deaths are tragic events for fans everywhere, but at least they usually have some closure in knowing what happened during an A-lister's final moments. Having the knowledge that your favorite celebrity passed on peacefully can make the grieving process a little bit easier.

However, these celeb autopsy reports only served to muddy the waters, making fans wonder what was really going on in the person’s life. Sometimes the autopsies have led to a more serious investigation, but usually, they only led to rumors and theories. Let’s take a look at a few of the most disturbing facts found in celebrity autopsy reports.

Mini Me Me Me: Kids Who Want It All (Celebrity Children Documentary) | Real Stories
Real Stories
This shocking one-hour documentary special takes us into the mini world of children who so desperately want to be celebrities at the age of 10 that they are already living the celebrity lifestyle; encouraged by their parents.

We meet a 10 year old girl who tells us she is on 'the list' as a potential match for Prince William. At the age of 8 her mother started her on a daily beauty regime, including a £200 per month hair routine, to prepare her for what lies ahead and as she reaches her 11th birthday, celebrating with a 'vogue party' she agrees with her mum that ‘you can never be too prepared for super model status! And it's not just the girls. Brothers, Skip and Frost, aged 10 & 12, are professional DJ's travelling from Cardiff to Ayia Napa. They know that networking is key to their success and are known as the So Solid Kids because they are best friends with group So Solid Crew and they want everything this successful adult band has.

Sometimes it is a natural shift brought about by the passage of time, like how years and turn milk into cheese, or a change brought about by external stimulus, like how being hit by a fast-moving bus can turn a person into a pancake. There are some celebrities who, as time has moved by, seem to have completely different faces. These are celebrities who are unrecognizable today!

Germany: The discreet lives of the super rich | DW Documentary
DW Documentary
The rich in Germany been never been as well-off as they are today and assets have never been so unevenly distributed. But who are they? How do they live? And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.

One percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country’s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. "Manager Magazin” says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary "Top of the World" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.

How 'Social Media Killed the Movie Star' | Why stars are becoming irrelevant (Full Film)
Kjersti Flaa
The rise of social media is turning traditional movie stars into relics of a bygone era. As the media paradigm shifts to influencer culture and all-access lifecasting, Kjersti Flaa investigates the effects on Hollywood–from the stars themselves to the fans and industry surrounding them.

Background; throughout the last decade we’ve seen a boom in celebrities joining Instagram - some without hesitation - others more reluctant. Host and producer, Kjersti Flaa has interviewed over 50 movie stars to find out about their social media habits.

Stars know that today their box office value gets measured in Instagram-fans – i.e. the more followers – the higher the chances of getting a part in the movie. 

Another aspect of this paradigm shift in Hollywood is the new instant connection fans can have with their favorite stars who now invites them into private sphere via social media. As Will Smith put it: “The era of movie stars is over. There is no longer a separation between famous people and the fans.” Some celebrities enjoy this new ability to control their own narrative - they don’t need the press or paparazzi anymore. Others are not as skilled, and the damage could be irreversible.

In this documentary we feature interviews with A-listers, as well as professors, reporters, pr-experts and other Hollywood industry people. Host Kjersti Flaa. 
Produced by Content Now TV, Kjersti Flaa, Camilla Hammer, Cassie Gill
Videographers: Magnus Sundholm, Martin Ehleben, Shant Markarian, Mario Garciduenas

Bob Ross: The Happy Painter - Full Documentary
Bob Ross
You’ve seen him before - he's the quiet soft-spoken guy with the fuzzy afro hair painting mountains and trees with big brushes in a matter of seconds. Bob Ross is public television's most beloved personality and here is the behind-the-story look at his journey to becoming America's pop-culture icon.

This docu-story reveals the personal life of Bob Ross through the loving accounts of close friends and family, childhood photographs, rare archive footage - what you know: his unwavering dedication to wildlife for example, and what you don't know: Bob Ross' straight hair, his fascination with fast cars, and so much more.

You'll see rare film clips of Bob Ross with mentor William Alexander, and the very first rough-cut Joy of Painting episode. And you'll learn how one little TV commercial to advertise local painting classes slowly turned this gentle-mannered fellow from simple beginnings into a viral phenomenon that continues to allow millions around the world to realize their dream of becoming an artist.

Enjoy fascinating interviews and insights from some famous Bob Ross enthusiasts too, such as talk show pioneer Phil Donahue, film stars Jane Seymour and Terrence Howard, Chef Duff Goldman, and country music favorites Brad Paisley and Jerrod Niemann.

Bob Ross: The Happy Painter is presented in three parts: The Man, The Television Artist, and His Legacy.
